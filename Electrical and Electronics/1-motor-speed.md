# Design a Circuit to Control the Speed of a DC Motor Using a Variable Resistor

### Objective
To control the speed of a DC motor by varying the voltage across it using a potentiometer (variable resistor).

### Components that may be Required
- DC Motor (rated for the power supply, e.g., 12V)
- Potentiometer (e.g., 10kΩ)
- NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222 or similar)
- Diode (e.g., 1N4007 to protect against back EMF)
- Resistor (1kΩ for base control of the transistor)
- DC Power Supply (e.g., 12V)
- Breadboard (optional)
- Connecting Wires
- Multimeter (optional, for testing)

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Understanding Datasheets**
   - Learn how to read and interpret datasheets, specifically the maximum voltage and current ratings for components such as the DC motor and the transistor.

2. **Understanding PWM**
   - Gain a basic understanding of how PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) can be applied in motor control circuits for more efficient speed control.

3. **Basic Understanding of Semiconductors and ICs**
   - Develop a fundamental understanding of semiconductor components (transistors) and how integrated circuits (ICs) like the 555 timer can be used in advanced motor speed control circuits.

4. **Circuit Design Capabilities**
   - Improve circuit design and assembly skills, particularly in creating practical control circuits for DC motors using common electronic components such as potentiometers, transistors, and diodes.
