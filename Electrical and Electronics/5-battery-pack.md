# Design and Diagram a Custom 3S Lithium-Ion Battery Pack

### Objective
Research and design a custom 3S lithium-ion battery pack using 18650 cells with a high discharge rate of 6C or above, including BMS selection. Document your various design choices.

### Components Required
- 18650 lithium-ion cells (6C discharge rate minimum)
- Battery Management System (BMS) for 3S configuration
- Drawing materials (paper, pencil, ruler)

### Task Deliverables
1. **Cell and BMS Selection**
   - Research and provide specifications
   - Include purchase links
   
2. **Connection Diagram**
   - Self-made diagram showing:
     - 3S configuration
     - BMS connections
     - Component labels

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of battery pack design and cell selection
- Knowledge of 3S lithium-ion battery configurations and BMS
- Research and analysis skills
- Ability to visualize and communicate electrical connections
