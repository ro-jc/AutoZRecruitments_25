# Design a Simple Power Distribution Board

### Objective
Design a power distribution board that converts a 22V input supply into 18V, 12V, and 5V outputs, each capable of delivering 10A or more.

### Components Required
1. Voltage Regulators or DC-DC Converters
2. Inductors and Capacitors
3. MOSFETs or Power Transistors (if needed)
4. High-power connectors
5. Heat sinks or other thermal management components
6. Protection circuits (fuses, surge protectors, etc.)

### PCB Design Tools
Same as previous task (Altium, KiCad, or EasyEDA)

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Knowledge of power distribution systems and voltage regulation for high-current applications
- Practical experience in designing PCBs for efficient power conversion
- Skills in selecting components for high-current, high-efficiency power designs
- Understanding thermal management techniques
- Familiarity with implementing safety and protection features
