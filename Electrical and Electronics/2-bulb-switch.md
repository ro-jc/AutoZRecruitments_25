# Using a MOSFET as a Switch to Control a Bulb

### Objective
Design and implement a circuit that uses a MOSFET to control a bulb. The MOSFET will act as an electronic switch, turning the bulb on and off based on an input signal.

### Components that may be Required
- N-channel MOSFET (e.g., IRF540 or similar)
- DC Power Supply (e.g., 12V)
- Bulb (compatible with the power supply voltage, e.g., 12V)
- Resistor (e.g., 1kÎ© for the MOSFET gate)
- Push Button or Digital Control Signal
- Breadboard (optional)
- Connecting Wires
- Multimeter (optional, for checking circuit functionality)

### Task Outcomes
1. **Understand the Working Principle of a MOSFET**
   - Understand how the MOSFET operates as a switch, and how the current flow between drain and source is controlled by the gate voltage.

2. **Understand Gate Control of MOSFETs**
   - Learn how different gate voltages affect the switching behavior of the MOSFET (on/off states) and its role in controlling the load (bulb).

3. **Analyse the Role of Resistors**
   - Learn how resistors, especially the gate resistor, are used to limit current and protect the MOSFET from excessive gate drive.

4. **Understand MOSFET Safety Considerations**
   - Understand the importance of component ratings, such as the maximum drain current and heat dissipation, especially in higher power circuits.
