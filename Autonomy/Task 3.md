# Task 3: Controlling TurtleBot3

## What youâ€™ll learn:

- Using gazebo for simulation
- Working with turtlebot3
- Taking input from sensors

## Task

The objective of this task is to spawn the turtlebot3 model on the turtlebot3 world in gazebo and simply keep it
running forward for as long as the simulation is running while it avoids any obstacles or walls that come up in it's
path by turning the other way.

## Deliverables

1. The ROS package that contains your node and any other external files you've created (only the particular folder
   within the `src/` directory in your workspace)
1. A short, simple screencast that shows your simulation. A video shot externally works too if you have trouble with
   screen recording ([OBS](https://obsproject.com/) may help: `sudo apt install obs-studio`).

## Resources

Ensure that you have gazebo installed and working (try typing `gazebo` into the terminal)

The instructions on [this page](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation)
(**ensure you have `Humble` selected at the top**) should give you all that you need in order to get up and running with
launching a simulation with the turtlebot3 int the turtlebot3 world as shown:
